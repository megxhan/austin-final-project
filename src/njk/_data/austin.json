The City of Austin created the reservoir in 1960 as a cooling pond for a new city power plant. The lake, which has a surface area of 416 acres (168 ha), is now used primarily for recreation and flood control. The reservoir is named in honor of former First Lady of the United States Lady Bird Johnson.</p>\n<p>Lady Bird Lake is a major recreation area for the City of Austin. The lake's banks are bounded by the Ann and Roy Butler Hike-and-Bike Trail, and businesses offer recreational watercraft services along the lakefront portion of the trail. Austin's largest downtown park, Zilker Park, is adjacent to the lake, and Barton Springs, a major attraction for swimmers, flows into the lake.</p>\n<p>- Source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Bird_Lake\">Wikipedia</a></p>"

It was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1969</p>\n<p>Mt. Bonnell has served as a popular attraction since the 1830s. Considered a more rural part of Austin then, picnics and outings were popular at the site, as well as entertainment, such as when Hazel Keyes, trailed by her monkey, slid down a cable stretched from the top of Mt. Bonnell to the south bank of the lake below in 1898. Today thousands of visitors ascend the 106 stone stairs to the summit to take in sweeping panoramic views of the lake, downtown, and the western hills of Austin.</p>\n<p>- Source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Bonnell\">Wikipedia</a></p>"
